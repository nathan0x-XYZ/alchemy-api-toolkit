> A comprehensive toolkit for working with Alchemy APIs, including debugging guides, error handling examples, and production-ready code samples.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of tools, guides, and code examples for effectively working with Alchemy's blockchain APIs. It is designed to help developers troubleshoot common issues, implement best practices, and build robust applications on top of Alchemy's infrastructure.

## Contents

- [**Debug Guide**](./alchemy-debug-guide-en.md) - Comprehensive guide for troubleshooting Alchemy API integration issues
- **Code Examples**:
  - [API Key Validation](./validate_api_key.py) - Validate Alchemy API keys and check permissions
  - [Network Connection Testing](./test_network_connection.py) - Test connectivity to Alchemy endpoints
  - [Rate Limiting](./rate_limiter.py) - Implement rate limiting to avoid API throttling
  - [Retry with Backoff](./retry_with_backoff.py) - Exponential backoff strategy for handling rate limits
  - [Webhook Validation](./webhook_validator.py) - Validate and process Alchemy webhooks
  - [NFT Data Retrieval](./fetch_nft_examples.py) - Fetch NFT data with pagination and error handling
  - [Complete Error Handling](./alchemy_api_debug.py) - Comprehensive error handling for all API calls

## Features

- ✅ **Production-ready code examples** - Copy and paste into your projects
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** - Catch and handle all possible API errors
- ✅ **Rate limit avoidance strategies** - Prevent hitting API rate limits
- ✅ **Webhook integration examples** - Process real-time blockchain events
- ✅ **NFT API implementation patterns** - Handle NFT data with best practices
- ✅ **Detailed debugging guide** - Troubleshoot common issues quickly

## Use Cases

This toolkit is designed for developers who are:

- Building dApps that need reliable blockchain data access
- Implementing NFT functionality in their applications
- Setting up monitoring and alerting for blockchain events
- Troubleshooting API integration issues
- Learning best practices for working with blockchain APIs

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nathan0x-XYZ/alchemy-api-toolkit.git
   cd alchemy-api-toolkit
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file and add your Alchemy API key:
   ```
   ALCHEMY_API_KEY=your_alchemy_api_key
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install web3 requests python-dotenv
   ```

4. Run any of the example scripts:
   ```bash
   python alchemy_api_debug.py
   ```

## Example Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the retry with backoff pattern:

```python
from retry_with_backoff import retry_with_backoff

@retry_with_backoff(max_retries=3, backoff_factor=1.5)
def get_eth_balance(address):
    # This function will automatically retry with exponential backoff
    # if it raises an exception
    response = requests.get(f"{ALCHEMY_API_URL}/getBalance", params={"address": address})
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()
```
